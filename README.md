TLDR
--
Each directory correlates to a challenge.<br/>
Inside there is a .jsx file, or "View" for the interface.<br/>
As well as a .js file containing the base solutions (solution which you might expect in a technical interview). - ie: basis for whole project<br/>
The user interface is for my own practice, and to make sharing my practice more interesting for others.<br/>

In SHORTER 
- The bare minimum of the challeges are contained in .js files. Eveything else is my own creativity and practice.


About
--
I was looking for interesting ways to practice fundamental algorithm practice. To stay sharp for interview and to simply gain skills.<br/>
When looking to see if there were any updates to the NSS curriculum (yes I already graduated but still check in as they provide amazing resources/review/projects), I noticed they had added some algorithmic practice challenges!<br/>
<br/>
I decided instead of simply solving the algorithms, as I could on any website like HackerRank or LeetCode, I would make a simple front-end react app, for a few reasons:<br/>

- Practice building a front-end app - React, react-router-dom, building with Vite, organizing file structure, etc.
- Practice styling with MaterialUI, specifically exploring some new (to me) components like NavTabs
- Practice algorithmic problem solving
- Provide not only coding solutions, but useful commentary into my thought process
- Have fun with code!

Getting Around
--
The landing page provides brief introduction to this project, mirroring many of the things in this file. <br/>

All other tabs contain a "view" which is a brief explanation of the problem, my approach to the problem solving, as well as the solution. <br/>

Some views may accept user input, or display result of algorithms based on clicking buttons etc. Depending upon the challenge.<br/>

I tried to be creative with the given challenges, display something interactive for the user, and also provide insight into my problem solving process.<br/>

Vanilla JavaScript - solving algorithmic challenges (basis of project)<br/>
React/Vite - used to build out the react app<br/>
React-router-dom - used for navigation<br/>
Material UI - for styling<br/>
